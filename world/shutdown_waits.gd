## Waits that end at shutdown. A coroutine still suspended when the engine exits leaves its
## pooled locals (Transform3D, AABB) alive past teardown, which logs "Pages in use exist at exit
## in PagedAllocator" (dev's bug: errors when quitting; tools/probe_exit_pools.gd reproduces it,
## whatever the coroutine awaited). The game calls begin() as its world leaves the tree: every
## pending wait resumes at once and returns false, so its caller unwinds while scripts still live.
