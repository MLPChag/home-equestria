## locomotion.
## The kiss (round 11, dev 2026-09-28: "her mouth WRAPPED around mine ... i want to see the bridge
## of her nose and her face not her mouth", "she needs a turn radius limited skeleton", "when i
## move my head around there's no lag"): her lips press onto his, her muzzle tipped up so her nose
## passes his and her lips sit below and behind her own muzzle, out of his sight. Her head chases
## that pose instead of snapping to it: her lip goal follows a critically damped spring with a top
## speed and her head angle a spring with a top turn rate. Her neck carries the head inside the
## rig's joint limits (pony_joint_limits.gd) and only a short way; beyond that her body turns and
## steps (pony_affection.gd reads neck_demand). Her skull and nose always stay clear of his eyes,
## at once, whatever the lag. While she kisses, her head wanders (turn, nod, tilt, pressing in and
## easing off, lips sliding) and in a deep kiss she changes the side she leans to now and then.
